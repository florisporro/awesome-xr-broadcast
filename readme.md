# Awesome XR Broadcast [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> AR, XR or VR broadcast is the discipline of using virtual objects to extend, augment or fully replace physical broadcast production studios. The resources required to setup such a virtual production are increasingly within the grasp of next-generation broadcasters running on a lower budget.

> This is a curated list of resources related to that discipline, its intention is to pool some of the resources together in one place to make it easier to get started.
